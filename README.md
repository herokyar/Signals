Signals
=======
Problem 1

Matlab programming will be reviewed by solving this first problem. Eulerâ€™s method will be used and some simple signals will be plotted. Also complex exponential signals will be generated and real and imaginary part of the signals will be plotted. 

Problem 2

In this problem, difference equations and frequency response of a signal will be examined.  The types of the filter (e.g. low pass filter, high pass filter or band pass filter) will be identified using the magnitude of the frequency response. 

Problem 3

The Fourier representation of a signal via the forward and inverse DTFT is a key part  of signal analysis. The analysis and synthesis equations are respectively,
The frequency response of an LTI system is the DTFT of its impulse response.
